# Data Science Intensive
## Jon Dickerson

This is the repo to house all of my work for the Data Science Intensive workshop for Springboard.com.

My final project examined the social network of television writers, eventually looking at the shows, and how they were connected by writers that wrote for both shows.

For instance, here's a network of Mad Men, The Sopranos, and Boardwalk Empire.
