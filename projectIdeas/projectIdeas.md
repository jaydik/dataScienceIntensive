# Project Ideas

## Baseball Projection system
I am very interested in sports statistics, and a big area where analytics is useful is projecting future performance. There are quite a few projection systems out there, so this is well-traveled ground, which could make the project difficult and/or trivial. My hope would be that there is some way that the advanced data science and machine learning techniques we cover here will be able to improve the performance. Alternatively, predicting breakout seasons or attrition season could be useful, and that would be a more classical binary response variable, very suitable to supervised learning techniques.


## Million Song Database
For this idea, I have a less developed question, but the dataset itself interests me quite a bit. It is a very large (300GB) dataset, which would require renting some AWS time, which appeals to me, as I would like to branch out into distributed solutions if possible. (I have not looked into pricing or anything like that but it is not a showstopper for me that it is not free) My initial ideas would be to see if there are certain attributes of songs that would cluster them into "genre" as we know it. Alternatively, predicting the billboard top 100 ratings for each of the songs in the dataset could be interesting. This is a rather old dataset, so I'd imagine that there are plenty of analysis already done with it, I'd need to be careful to not unknowingly duplicate anything. 

## NYPL Dataset
The New York Public Library just released a very large Public Domain dataset, containing metadata for all the works in their collection. Very interesting dataset, and given its relative freshness, there would be very little that has already been done with it, so any analysis I did would be likely to be quite fresh. I have not examined the dataset enough yet to formulate a good question to answer, so there is still an element of "who cares?" to this idea.

## IMDB Dataset
I quite enjoyed the pandas tutorial from PyCon 2015, and the instructor made frequent use of the IMDB dataset, containing actor/actress, title, release date information on movies ranging from the 19th century to future releases. It has *definitely* been done before, but "6 degrees of Kevin Bacon" type analysis is very interesting to me, so if I could rework the idea to be new and fresh, that could be a potential idea.
