## Problem
Do certain writers (or combinations of writers) lead to "better" movies/TV shows?

## Client
Given a definitive answer to this question, any Hollywood production company would be able to assemble teams that would have a better than average chance of producing a successful, well-received movie or show.

## Data
The data set I'll utilize will be the IMDB data set. It has information for writers and the projects they worked on. I can parse this out and determine if there are certain writers more successful than others. I can define success and "better" using the IMDB ratings for the films/shows.

## Approach
Given a well cleaned IMDB data set -- which in itself will be some work -- I should be able to parse out the contributions of the writers. The difficult part will be controlling for other factors, budgets, cast, director, etc. Given the large number of potential variables, the ability to isolate the contribution of the authors should increase.

## Deliverable
Theoretically, the analysis should produce some scores for all the writers (or some subset) as to the potential IMDB score for a film/show they worked on. This could be used to sum the contributions of all writers and predict the IMDB rating of a film/show before it gets rated. Depending on the timing of the project deliverables, they ability to predict the IMDB score could be tested on real-world data. The code, along with a paper and slide deck can be prepared and presented.
